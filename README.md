### Algorithm Implementations in MosML, Gforth and C

#### Moscow ML
Is a light-weight implementation of Standard ML (SML), a strict functional
language widely used in teaching and research.
Web site https://mosml.org/
The Moscow ML implementation can be found at https://github.com/kfl/mosml.

#### Gforth
Is a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth/Forth 200x language.
It works nicely with the Emacs editor, offers some nice features such as input
completion and history, backtraces, a decompiler and a powerful locals facility,
and it has a comprehensive manual. Gforth combines traditional implementation
techniques with newer techniques for portability and performance:
its inner interpreter is direct threaded with several optimizations, but you can
also use a traditional-style indirect threaded interpreter.
Gforth is distributed under the GNU General Public license (see COPYING).
The Gforth implementation can be found at https://github.com/forthy42/gforth

#### C
Is c.
